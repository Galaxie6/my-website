                <h2>New Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a new developer that started to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript because of Hack Club (High Seas Specifically!)
                    I hope I can make better websites and actually start to use JavaScript in the future!
                </p>

            <div class="Nationality">
                <h2>Chinese, well kind of...</h2>
                <p>
                    I am (kind of) Chinese... but I identify as a "Hong Konger" :3
                    I moved to the UK during the Covid-19 period and has ever been there ever since.
                    No, I am not Bri'ish.
                    <br> <br>
                    p.s. Do not look at my passport it definitely says "Hong Konger" I promise

                <h2>I know Lua (but it's too simple so it doesn't count)</h2>
                <p>
                    I know intermediate levels of Lua and... mediocre levels of HTML and CSS.
                    Don't even get me started on JavaScript, I need to learn that someday.

                    I only worked on the UI :smug:
